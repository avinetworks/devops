# Baremetal Preparation

This directory contains a few example playbooks for deploying Avi on Baremetal, or a Base OS install.

These examples will not work for everyone and are intended only as a starting point, or idea of how to install Avi with Ansible. Executing a simple copy and paste can make your host unreachable and will require a fresh install, they could also delete a partition accidently if values are incorrect.

You will likely want to add or customize the tasks to meet your environment needs. Also, these examples are expecting the host to have internet access. If there is no internet access then they will likely fail.
